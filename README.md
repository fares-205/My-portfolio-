> Welcome to my portfolio!

I'm Fares, a professional Web Developer with two years of experience, specialized in building and designing websites from scratch — both in code and in visual experience.

I work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python to create responsive, high-performance websites. My focus on UI/UX design ensures every site I build is not only functional but also visually engaging and user-friendly.

In addition to development, I'm a skilled content writer with experience in crafting all types of content — from blogs and product descriptions to ads and professional copywriting.

I'm also a multilingual translator, delivering accurate and culturally adapted translations in Arabic, English, Spanish, German, Italian, French, and Swedish.

I value clean work, clear communication, and client satisfaction above all. Whether it’s coding, designing, writing, or translating — I’m here to help your ideas come to life.

Let’s build something exceptional together!
